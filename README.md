# HttpBun

This is a rewrite, not a port. So, there will be minor differences in how the server responds in some edge cases. If you
notice any such case, please report in a GitHub issue.

I wrote this as an attempt to learn Golang, and because I needed something like this, with a few extra features.
Besides, it looks like httpbin isn't being as actively developed as it once was, and it's become _very_ slow in recent
years. I was a heavy user of httpbin, so I decided to build something similar.

**Why not fork and fix httpbin?**: No big reason really. I was also looking for something to play in Golang, so this was
a good fit.
