# Httpbun

Hosted version available at [httpbun.com](https://httpbun.com) and mirrored at [httpbun.org](https://httpbun.org). RUn
with docker as `docker run -p 80:80 ghcr.io/sharat87/httpbun`.

This is an HTTP service with endpoints that are useful when testing any HTTP client, like a browser, a library, or any
API developer tool. It's heavily inspired by [httpbin](https://httpbin.org).

I wrote this as an attempt to learn Golang, and because I needed something like this, with a few extra features, from
httpbin. Besides, it looks like httpbin isn't being as actively developed as it once was, and it's become _very_ slow
for me in recent years. I was a heavy user of httpbin, so I decided to build something similar.

**Why not fork/fix httpbin?**: No big reason really. I was also looking to develop something to learn Golang, so this
was a good fit.

## Contributing

Contributions to httpbun are welcome, for the most part. However, I strongly urge you to open an issue to discuss
whatever you're working to contribute *before* you start working on it. This will ensure we are on the same page and
your work would be in the right place to be merged in. It'll also ensure we don't end up working on the same thing,
duplicating efforts. Thanks!
